This project was part of my Master's degree, wherein we had to create a blogging system.

User Accounts 
- If an user deletes their account, any comments made by them are replaced with the text "Comment has been deleted", and their
username is changed to "unknown" for that comment.

Articles 
- Article text cannot be empty. Users must input something into the body.

Comments
- The author makes/replies to a comment.

It was decided to take a slightly different approach to this as we thought that it was counter-intuitive as why would a subscriber
be notified for any comment/reply that an author makes. So we have rewritten it so that an user gets notified for any reply they
receive on a comment they have written.
