User Accounts Q.7
- If an user deletes their account, any comments made by them are replaced with the text "Comment has been deleted", and their
username is changed to "unknown" for that comment.

Articles Q.12
- Article text cannot be empty. Users must input something into the body.

Comments Q.20 ii
- The author makes/replies to a comment.

We have decided to take a slightly different approach to this as we thought that it was counter-intuitive as why would a subscriber
be notified for any comment/reply that an author makes. So we have rewritten it so that an user gets notified for any reply they
receive on a comment they have written.
